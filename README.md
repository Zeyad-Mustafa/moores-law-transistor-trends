Moore’s Law states that the number of transistors on a chip roughly doubles every two years, which implies a halving of transistor size over time.
This project visualizes historical transistor scaling and estimates the halving period using logarithmic regression.

 Graph Explanation: Transistor Size Over Time
When you visualize Moore’s Law, you usually have a graph with:

X-axis (horizontal): Year
This shows the timeline of semiconductor development.

Starts from around 1970 (Intel 4004 era) and goes up to today (2024 and beyond).

Each year marks a point where a new manufacturing process or "node" was introduced.

Y-axis (vertical): Transistor Size in Nanometers (nm)
This represents the length of the transistor gate, often called the process node size.

Measured in nanometers (nm) — 1 nm = one-billionth of a meter.

Typical values over the years:

1971: 10,000 nm

1990: 800 nm

2004: 90 nm

2016: 14 nm

2022: 5 nm

2024: 3 nm

The scale is usually logarithmic, because the size shrinks exponentially, not linearly.
